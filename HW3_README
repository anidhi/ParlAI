Implementation of HRED.In this folder, there is a parlai_hred folder that has the hred model agent and hredbot folder which has the necessary files to connect to Alexa skill.
However, for complete code of ParlAI please go to the master_new branch. master_new branch was the branch that gradescope wasnt able to accomodate.
1) how to run instructions,  3) link to the model parameters file

Model was trained with:

python examples/train_model.py -t dailydialog -m internal:hred -mf [Wherever you want this to be] -nl 2 -rnn gru -hiddensize 512 -esz 256

To run, clone this repo into a folder so that the path to hred.py is at ParlAI/parlai_internal/agents/hred/hred.py
